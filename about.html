      <h2>Academic</h2>
      <p> Currently I am a fourth year electrical engineering student at the University of Victoria. I am involved
        with the University of Victoria's Satellite Design Team. I used to be part of the power team, lead the payload team, and
        currently act as Project Manager for clubs team participating in the Canadian Satellite Design Competition. Throughout my degree I have
        focused on embedded systems, mechatronic systems, and power systems. Come graduation I will have a specializations associated with those areas
        alongside my bachelors of engineering. </p>
      </br>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p> I have a variety of hobbies that I am passionate about:
      <ul>
        <li>Cooking</li>
        <p>Cooking is my hobby that I feel the most freedom in. Cooking provides endless opportunities to create dishes with different flavour profiles.
          One of my favourite dishes to make is Schnitzel mit Sp√§tzle und Rotkohl. A dish I recently made that I am quite proud of was cordon bleu with
          a carrot salad dressed with a french vinaigrette.</p>
        <li>Scouting</li>
        <li>Formula 1</li>
      </ul>
      </br>

      <h2> Personal Development</h2>
      <p>For my own personal development I am working towards my Gold Duke of Edinburgh Award. This award focuses on service, skill development, and
        physical development. Another requirement is to complete a project and to embark on two different expiditions.</p>
      <p>Another goal I am working towards is being able to solve a Rubik's Cube in under 30 seconds. I'm learning the Roux method and can currently
        solve the cube in 2+ minutes.</p>
