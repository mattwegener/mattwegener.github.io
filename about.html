      <h2>Academic</h2>
      <p> Currently I am a fourth year electrical engineering student at the University of Victoria. I am involved
        with the University of Victoria's Satellite Design Team. I used to be part of the power team, lead the payload team, and
        currently act as Project Manager for clubs team participating in the Canadian Satellite Design Competition. Throughout my degree I have
        focused on embedded systems, mechatronic systems, and power systems. Come graduation I will have a specializations associated with those areas
        alongside my bachelors of engineering. </p>
      </br>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p> I have a variety of hobbies that I am passionate about:
      <ul>
        <li>Cooking:</br>
            Cooking is my hobby that I feel the most freedom in. Cooking provides endless opportunities
            to create dishes with different flavour profiles. One of my favourite dishes to make is
            Schnitzel mit Sp√§tzle und Rotkohl. A dish I recently made that I am quite proud of was
            cordon bleu with a french carrot salad dressed in a vinagrette.
        </li></br>

        <li>Scouting:</br>
            Currently I am a member of the 33rd Greater Victoria MedRover Crew. This group is a vocational scouting group
            that specializes in first aid. The group volunteers offering first aid services to public and Scouting events.
        </li></br>

        <li>Formula 1:</br>
            I started following Formula 1 in 2013 and quickly become a Lotus fan with my favourite driver being Kimi Raikonnen.
            The disbandment of Lotus and Kimi changing teams lead to me becoming a fan of his new team: Ferrari. In 2014 there was a rules change
            issuing the hybrid engine era for F1. In this new era, Mercedes' F1 team has dominated the sport with 4 championshios. Unforunately other front runners,
            Ferrari and Redbull, haven't won a championship in this age. The next major rule change comes in 2021 and could usher in a new exciting era of Technical
            development.

      </ul>

      <h2> Personal Development</h2>
      <p>For my own personal development I am working towards my Gold Duke of Edinburgh Award. This award focuses on service, skill development, and
        physical development. Another requirement is to complete a project and to embark on two different expiditions.</p>
      <p>Another goal I am working towards is being able to solve a Rubik's Cube in under 30 seconds. I'm learning the Roux method and can currently
        solve the cube on average in 1:40.3 minutes. My top time as of August 2019 is 1:04.8</p>
