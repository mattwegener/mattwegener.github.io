        <li>Conveyor Belt Sorting System</li>
        <p>This project was undertook as part of the Fall 2018 MECH 458 course at the University of Victoria.
          The project is an implementation of an embedded control system for a
          conveyor belt and tray equipped with a sensor array, in order to detect
          classify and sort cylinders according to their four different material
          types: aluminium, steel, white plastic, and black plastic. The objective
          was to sort 48 pieces, 12 of each material, in under 60 seconds.
          The mechanical system and its sensors and actuators interface with an
          AVR AT90USB1287 development board which runs the embedded control
          program. Items are classified using data from a reflectivity sensor and
          inductive sensor. Optical sensors provide timing and gating information
          to the program. A brushed DC motor actuates the belt, while a 200-step
          stepper motor actuates the sorting tray. The video below highlights the system
          my lab partern and I implemented in action. Our system completed the objective
          in 25s with 1 sorting error allowing us to have top time and performance of the semester.</p>
