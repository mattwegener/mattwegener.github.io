      <ul>
        <li>Personal Website</li>
        <p>I am contsrtucting this website as a personal project to learn how
        to program using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. It will also give me a chance
        to learn how to webhost with github and to setup a custom domain. This website
        is a living project and is constently changing as I learn more about webdevelopment.</p>

        <li>Singular Value Decomposition algorithm</li>
        <p>Implemented on an armv7 virtual machine, a cyclic Jacobi algorithm was
        used to perform singular value decomposition on a NxN input matrix. The
        intitial algorithm was implemented using floating point arithmitic. From
        there three avenues of optimization were taken: fixed point arithmitic;
        trignometric function approximations; and SIMD operations. </p>

      <h2>Past Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Conveyor Belt Sorting System</li>
        <p>This project was undertook as part of the Fall 2018 MECH 458 course at the University of Victoria.
          The project is an implementation of an embedded control system for a
          conveyor belt and tray equipped with a sensor array, in order to detect
          classify and sort cylinders according to their four different material
          types: aluminium, steel, white plastic, and black plastic. The objective
          was to sort 48 pieces, 12 of each material, in under 60 seconds.
          The mechanical system and its sensors and actuators interface with an
          AVR AT90USB1287 development board which runs the embedded control
          program. Items are classified using data from a reflectivity sensor and
          inductive sensor. Optical sensors provide timing and gating information
          to the program. A brushed DC motor actuates the belt, while a 200-step
          stepper motor actuates the sorting tray. The video below highlights the system
          my lab partern and I implemented in action. Our system completed the objective
          in 25s with 1 sorting error allowing us to have top time and performance of the semester.
          Source code is available on my lab partners <a href="https://github.com/noahrondeau/MECH458_project">github.</a></p>

          <li>Earliest Deadline First Scheduler</li>
          <p>This project was done as part of ECE 455 Lab at the University of Victoria.
             The project was to implement an Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduler and algorithm.
             Built on top of FreeRTOS scheduler, it is intended for scheduling periodic and aperiodic tasks.
             The system implemented utilizes a STM32 Discovery microcontroller board.
             Functionally the MCU is more than adequate for the scheduler implemented.
             The implemented scheduler uses auxiliary tasks for generation of user tasks
             and for monitoring the system. The monitor provides a snapshot of the current active and
             overdue task lists which are printed to the consol. Source code for this project
             can be found on my lab partners <a href="https://github.com/noahrondeau/ECE455_Project3">github.</a>
             Testing of the system was done with tasks defined by the instructor.</p>

          <li>Beacon Tracking Robot</li>
          <p>In my first year of university, one of the projects I did with a team was
          building a beacon tracking robot. The platform the robot was built on used a
          Vex Robotics kit and was programmed using RobotC. The objective of
          the robot was to autonmously navigate to a beacon emmiting infrared light inside a ring,
          retrieve on object placed ontop of the beacon, and then remove it from the ring. The purpose
          of the project was to simulate the removal of radioactive waste from a contaminated zone. My primary
          responsibality in the robots development was programming the algorithms and interfacing with the sensors.
          I also aided with assembling robot chasis & body and making sensor circuits.</p>

          <li>Cabin Architectural Plans</li>
          <p>In highschool I was given the chance to work with a team to draft architectural
          plans for a client’s cabin. I was responsible for the cabins cross
          section blueprints. At the end of the project, the blueprints went on to be approved by the municipality.</p>
